This week
---------

- Team labs.
- Lecture: scanner, data types, conditionals.

Team labs
---------

First meeting this week (1350 and 1370 CS).

- Ice breaker, be assigned a partner and do the lab together.
- Pair programming.

5 points per lab, arriving > 5 minutes late and leaving > 5 minutes early will result in a 2 point penalty.

#### Pair programming

- 2 people working together on 1 computer.
- One person types, the other provides direction and reviews.
- Many report more confidence in solution and more enjoyment programming.
- Import to switch roles (who has the keyboard).
- Provide respectful, honest, and friendly feedback.

P1 - Review quiz
----------------

Now available, due 8:00 A.M on Thursday (Sept. 15th, 2016).

- First two milestones are autograded.
- Third milestone additional tests and human graded.

**Milestone is individual work: discuss concepts, don't share code.**

Piazza notes
------------

**Don't** post your code publicly (working or not). You can post code from the book only if you cited it.

What are values of variables?
-----------------------------

The following sample code contains a string with special `newline` characters, which specifies a string contains multiple lines but not a single line with special characters that formats the variable declaration.

Therefore `input.nextLine()` really reads everything before a `newline` character (`\n` in this case).

```java
String note = "Minsub\n22\nCS"
Scanner input = new Scanner( note );

String name = input.nextLine(); // Minsub
int age = input.nextInt(); // 22
String major = input.nextLine(); // Nothing
```

Process of this code shows roughly as follows.

```java
input.nextLine()  ->    "Minsub\n22\nCS"
                                 ^
input.nextInt()   ->    "Minsub\n22\nCS"
                                   ^
```

Notice how the pointer stopped before the second `\n` notation after `input.nextInt()`. The next `input.nextLine()` therefore will read the next "line", which unfortunately will be the second `\n` itself, resulting in an empty string.

`major` will be assigned with an empty string, but not the expected `CS` assignment.

#### Another example

```java
String note = " 20 25\nscores";
Scanner input = new Scanner( note );

int score1 = input.nextInt(); // 20
int score2 = input.nextInt(); // 25
String title = input.nextLine(); // Nothing
```

Where `title`, similar to the last example, instead of reading `scores` after `\n`, the pointer was positioned before the `\n` after the second `input.nextInt()` call.

Reading `\n` results an empty variable assignment.

#### To fix the issue

```java
String note = " 20 25\nscores";
Scanner input = new Scanner( note );

int score1 = input.nextInt(); // 20
int score2 = input.nextInt(); // 25
input.nextLine(); // Run along, ignore end of line
String title = input.nextLine(); // scores
```

<div class="page-break"></div>

A clunky visualization.

```java
input.nextInt()   ->    "20 25\nscores"
                           ^
input.nextInt()   ->    "20 25\nscores"
                              ^
input.nextLine()  ->    "20 25\nscores"
                                ^
input.nextLine()  ->    "20 25\nscores"
                                      ^
```

Number Systems
--------------

- Decimal: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Binary: 0, 1

#### Order

With a decimal "302", the order of "3", "0", and "2", the order changes the actual value of the decimals.

This is also the case for binaries.

```
Binary:   100   10    1
Decimal:  3     0     2
```

#### Calculation of binaries

1110 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 14

#### Bits, nibbles, bytes

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
                              _
                              Bit
                        _______
                        Nibble
                _______________
                Byte
```

<div class="page-break"></div>

#### Hexadecimal: group bits by nibble.

```
0000  =   0
0001  =   1
0010  =   2
0011  =   3
0100  =   4
...
1000  =   8
1001  =   9
1010  =   A
1111  =   F
...
```

Java stores value in Hexadecimal. Like follows.

```
0000 0000 0100 0001 = 0x0041 = 65
```

See [Unicode](http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~tomw/java/unicode.html).

#### Connection: colors

RGB (Red, Green, Blue), color is described by "amount" of each of these colors.

Red | Green | Blue
----|-------|-----
183 | 1     | 1

Which translates into Hexadecimal values, forming HTML RGB colors.

Primitive data types
--------------------

Type    | Property
--------|-----------------------------------------
int     | Whole numbers, 4 bytes (4 bytes, 32-bit)
double  | Floating point numbers (8 bytes, 64-bit)
char    | Single character (2 bytes, 16-bit)
boolean | True or false value (>= 1 bit)

Less commonly used: float, long, short, byte.

There are, in total, 8 primitive data types provided in Java.

Boolean operators (comparison)
------------------------------

Operator  | Meaning
----------|----------------------
==        | Equality
!=        | Inequality
<         | Smaller than
<=        | Smaller than or equal to
>=        | Larger than or equal to

```java
int n = 6
boolean result = (n != 5); // True
```

Primitive vs Reference data types
---------------------------------

- Primitive: Stores values.
- Reference: Stores a reference to a location in memory to find value.

#### Example: java.util.Random

```java
Random randGen; // Declare reference variable
randGen = new Random(); // Create instance
//  randGen.setSeed(123); // Set state
int valueA = randGen.nextInt(5); // Get a value
int valueB = randGen.nextInt(5);
int valueC = randGen.nextInt(5);
```

With a `setSeed()` call, the state in random number generator will be stored, therefore producing reproducible results. Or producing a pseudo-random number generator.

Calling String methods
----------------------

```java
String strA = "This is a String";
char aChar = StrA.charAt(3);

boolean answer;
answer = aChar == 'i';
```

The program outputs `s`, as the character mapping of a `String` could be visualized as follows.

```
T  h  i  s     i  s     a     S  t  r  i  n  g
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15
```
