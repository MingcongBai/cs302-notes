All about Objects
-----------------

```java
public class Dog {
  public String name;
  private final int ID;
  static int numIds = 0;

  public Dog(String name) {
    name = name;
    ID = ++numIds;        // Op 1
  }

  public String toString() {
    return name + ID;
  }
}
```

```java
new Dog("Fido");
new Dog("Sadie");
```

1. Is there a no-argument constructor for `Dog`? No, and given that a constructor is already provided, a default constructor will not be automatically created.
2. Is values of dog's names saved to an instance variable? No, they were never saved, use `this.name = name;`.
3. Can a `final` variable assigned in a constructor? Yes, see Op 1.

Note: A default constructor is created with `public` scope.

### Scopes Review

| Descriptor   | Scope                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `private`    | Class scope, not visible outside of class. |
| `public`     | World scope                                |
| `protected`  | Package scope                              |
| (none)       | Package scope                              |

Overriding Methods
------------------

In "Apple.java" of package "data".

```java
package data;

public class Apple {
  private int size;
  // Any return type specified makes a method a
  // normal method, instead of a constructor.
  public Apple() {
    this.size = 5;
  }
  private Apple(String name) {
    this.name = name
  }
  // Automatically inherited.
  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    // "this" refers to the argument passed in,
    // "apple2" in this case.
    if (obj == this) {
      return true;
    }
    // Check if object is an instance of Apple.
    else if (obj instanceof Apple) {
      // Downcasting objApple as an object.
      Apple objApple = (Apple)obj;
      // Note that this equals comes from the String
      // standard class, but not the one overriden.
      if (this.name.equals(objApple.name)) {
        return true;
      }
      else {
        return false;
      }
    }
    else {
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

"Pie.java" of package "ui".

```java
public class Pie {
  public static void main(String [] args) {
    Apple anApple = new Apple("Pink Lady");
    Apple apple2 = new Apple(" Braeburn");
    System.out.println(anApple.equals(apple2));
  }
}
```

Common Misconceptions
---------------------

True or False. why?

- **The computer knows the intention of a piece of code and acts accordingly?**
  - False. the computer never knows about the intention.
- **Assignment move a value from one variable to another?**
  - False. it **copies** the values.
- **Assignment works in both directions?**
  - False.
- **Assignment copies a alue from the right side to the variable on the left side?**
  - True. in contrast to 2.
- **Expressions (not their values) are passed as parameters?**
  - False. the result is.
- **A varioable can hold multiple values at a time?**
  - False. it is always overriden, unless a class is created to hold a stack of all values (array lists?).
- **A variable remembers old values?**
  - False. not for primitive types.
- **In Java, objects and instances are the same thing (synonymous) and are different from classes?**
  - True. objects and instances are the same thing in Java, but not the same class.
- **The variables for storing and assigning primitive values are fundamentally different from the variables used for storing objects?**
  - True. one holds value, the other holds a reference to a value in memory.
- **Even primitive values (in Java) are handled through references?**
  - False.
-  **A variable associated with an object is merely a name which can be used to manipulate an object or "thing" in a program?**
  - False. a variable is an object to reference to values.
- **A (non-primitive Java) variable does not hold a reference but a set of object properties?**
  - True.
- **Assigning an object means "sending an object" (or a copy) to a variable?**
  - False. merely assigning a new address in memory.
- **Two objects with the same value of a "name" attribute are the same object?**
  - False.
- **Two variables must refer to two different objects?**
  - False.
- **Two objects with the same class are the same state are the same object?**
  - False.
- **An object is a subset of a class?**
  - False.
- **An object is a subtype of a class?**
  - False.
- **A set (such as "team" or "the species of birds") cannot be a class?**
  - False.
- **Constructor can include only assignment statements to initialize attributes?**
  - False.
- **Instantiation involves only the execution of the constructor method body, not the allocation of memory?**
  - False. Instantiation allocates memory as the first order of business.
- **Declaring a variable also creates an object?**
  - False. One would need to create an object separately.
- **There is no need to invoke the constructor because its definition is sufficient for object creation?**
  - False. a call is necessary.
- **An object cannot be the value of an variable?**
  - False. `private String name = new Foo()`. A reference to an object could be a value of a variable.
- **Storing an object in memory means storing a copy of the program code of the object's class?**
  - False. This is an allocation of an instance variable in memory.
