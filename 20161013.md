============

What are values of x and y?
---------------------------

```java
static int x;         // Op 0.
static int y = 2;

static int methodA(int y) {
  x = y + 1;           // Op 1.
  return x + y;
}

public static void main(String [] args) {
  int x = 5;
  y = methodA(x);
  System.out.println("x=" + x + " y=" + y);
}
```

Note that `x` in the method was declared from Op 0 as a static int variable, not the one from the `main()` method - which was passed into the `methodA()` method, as `y`.

In Op 1, a variable `x`, declared in Op 0, was assigned as `y + 1`, which results in 6 (from the initial `x = 5` passed in). However, `int x = 5` from the `main()` method was **not** replaced by the `static int x` from the class.

Therefore, the result of this sample of code:

```
x=5 y=11
```

What kind of methods?
---------------------

```java
Math.max(10,20);

Random randGen = new Random();
randGen.nextInt(5);
```

Note that:

- Class methods (static)
- Instances methods (non-static)

In this case:

- `max` is a class (static) method from the `Math` class imported by `java.util.Math`.
- `nextInt` is an **instance** (non-static) method predefined with Java (note that `randGen` is defined with a `Random` type, but not from within a class).

What prints out? (Array Comparison)
-----------------------------------

```java
char [] chars1 = {'x', 'y', 'z'};
char [] chars2 = {'x', 'y', 'z'};

System.out.println(chars1 == chars2);
System.out.println(chars1.equals(chars2));
```

This sample of code will print out...

```
false
false
```

Both `chars1` and `chars2` are **references in the memory**, therefore:

- A reference comparison `==` will return false;
- A `equals` statement compares a **reference** in the case of an array (instead, with `String` type, a `equals` statement compares **contents**).

What prints out? (Array Element Comparison)
-------------------------------------------

```java
String []pies = new String[3];
pies[0] = "pizza";
pies[1] = new String("pizza");
pies[2] = "pizza";

System.out.println(pies[1] == pies[2]);       // Op 1
System.out.println(pies[1].equals(pies[2]));  // Op 2
```

This sample of code will print out...

```
false
true
```

With Op 1, a `new` statement was passed for assigning a value "pizza" to `pies[1]` (the 2nd element in the array `pies`), given that a `String` is immutable - therefore `pies[0]` and `pies[2]` is presented as the same object to the compiler.

However the `new` statement specified that `pies[1]` contain a standalone copy of "hello" in memory. Again, `==` compares references, then obviously `pies[1]` and `pies[2]` are obviously different. Returning false.

Op 2, as defined, `equals` compares contents, "hello" is the same as "hello". Returning true.

However, if we change the program as...

```java
String []pies = new String[3];
pies[0] = "pizza";
pies[1] = new String("pizza");
pies[2] = "pizza";

System.out.println(pies[0] == pies[2]);       // Op 1
System.out.println(pies[1].equals(pies[2]));  // Op 2
```

Op 1 will instead output "true". As two immutable variables (String-typed) are considered to be the same copy in memory, with the **same reference**, therefore a reference comparison is valid.

What is output? (Scanner)
-------------------------

```java
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
input.nextLine();                       // 1st line, "3", is skipped.
int count = 4;

if (input.hasNextInt())                 // 2nd line is "hello", no int type found.
  count = input.nextInt();              // Skipped.
else {
  input.nextLine();                     // Jumped over 2nd line.
  count = input.nextInt();              // Reads the 3rd line "2", before the newline.
}

System.put.println(input.nextLine());   // Reads the following newline character.
```

With original user input:

```
3
hello
2
8 line
5 line
3 line
4 line
```

This sample of code will output...

```

```

Yes, an empty output. As explained in the comments from the original sample.

Note that a "newline" character is a String of zero length.

Where is memory allocated?
--------------------------

```java
class S {
  public static void main(String [] args) {
    String name;
    new String("fido");
    name = new String("spot");
  }
}
```

In this sample of code:

- `name` is stored in the stack, as the variable is declared within `main()`.
- "fido" is stored in the heap, as the String was never stored in a variable.

Where is print out? (Method Interaction)
----------------------------------------

```java
static int one() {
  System.out.print("one ");
}

static int two(int num) {
  System.out.println("two ");
  one();
  System.out.println("two ")
}

public static void main(String [] args) {
  two(3);
  System.out.println("main ");
}
```

If not for the error in the original sample of code...

```java
static void one() {
  System.out.print("one ");
}

static void two(int num) {
  System.out.println("two ");
  one();
  System.out.println("two ")
}

public static void main(String [] args) {
  two(3);                       // Argument disregarded, never used in method.
  System.out.println("main ");
}
```

The sample of code prints out...

```
two one two main
```

Note that there is an **extra whitespace** after the "main" printed out.

What is print out? (String operations)
--------------------------------------

```java
String str = "Falling Off a Cliff" +
    + "by Eileen Dover";
System.out.println(str.substring(3,7));   // "ling".

String str2 = "The Future of Robotics" +
    + " by Cy Borg and Anne Droid";
System.out.println(                       // Op 1.
  str2.substring(str2.indexOf('e') + 1,   // substring(3,11).
  str2.indexOf('o')).trim());             // " Future " -> trimmed -> "Future".
```

Execution explained in comments.

However, a shortcut in doing this in Op 1 will be to find the first "e", then count up to the first "o" (as specified), but not including "o" itself, returning " Future ".

Note the **trim()** method, however, will remove all preceeding **and** proceeding spaces in a String, finalizing the substring to "Future".

Can methodB change number?
--------------------------

```java
public static void main(String [] args) {
  double number = 5.0;
  methodB(number);
  System.println(number);   // Tong'jia to System.out.println();
                            // "I was printing out you guys' exams, 900 of them!"
                            // Guai'wo'lo...
}
```

`double` is a primitive type, with its content passed to a method as an argument, but never stored back.

Can methodB change list, contents?
----------------------------------

```java
public static void main(String [] args) {
  double [] list = {5.0, 3.2, 2.1};
  methodB(list);
  System.out.println(Arrays.toString(list));
}
```

In this sample of code, it can be implied that:

- The array `list` itself may not be changed by any method - as it was declared in the `main()` method.
- The array's content, however, may be chagned by a method - as an array's content was stored in a shared area of memory, any method can therefore change the content of the array.

Say, the method may look like...

```java
static void methodB(double [] d) {
  d[1] = 10.2;
}
```

As the array `list` itself was passed to this hypothetical method as an argument, its contents are exposed in the shared memory. Then the second element of the array is changed to "10.2".
