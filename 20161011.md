What will print out and why?
----------------------------

```java
int k = 'A';
System.out.println(k);
```

In this case, `k` is assigned with a letter, which was **implicitly casted** to an integer (65, according to the ASCII table). There is **no** loss of information. Recall from former lectures.

Type    | Property
--------|-----------------------------------------
int     | Whole numbers, 4 bytes (4 bytes, 32-bit)
double  | Floating point numbers (8 bytes, 64-bit)
char    | Single character (2 bytes, 16-bit)
boolean | True or false value (>= 1 bit)

A `char` has a smaller size than an `int` data type.

What is the "answer"?
---------------------

```java
String s1 = "An important programming tool.";
String s2 = s1.substring[9,10];
String s4 = new String("?");

if (s1.contains("gram")) {
  s4 = s1.substring(2,4).trim();
}

char c3 = s1.charAt(s1.indexOf('g') - 3);

String answer = (s2 + c3 + s4).toUpperCase();
```

- `s1` - "An important programming tool".
- `s2` - "a", taken from the 10th character (substring of length 1, a character).
- `s4` - As `s1` does contain the character sequence "gram".
  - `s4` will become the substring formed by the 3rd, and 4th characters, " i", while being trimmed, becomes "i".
- `c3` - 'g' from `s1` has the index of 16, 16 - 3 = 13: the character at index 13 is 'p'.
- `answer` - "A" + 'P' + "I", API (from upper-cased "api"). Note that 'P' is implicitly casted as a `String` typed object.

What is the output?
-------------------

```java
public static void countChar(char [] chars) {
  if (chars.length > 0 && chars != null)
    System.out.println("chars");
  else
    System.out.println("no chars");
}

public static void main(String [] args) {
  char []list = null;
  countChar(list);
}
```

This sample will return a runtime error, which describes a "null pointer reference".

```java
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
	at draft.countChar(draft.java:5)
	at draft.main(draft.java:13)
```

The array was never allocated, as it was initialized with a size of `null`, or empty reference. The error comes at the first `if` statement, as the program tries to reference an empty pointer (null pointer).

Fixing this sample of code only involves a short-circuiting...

```java
public static void countChar(char [] chars) {
  if (chars != null && chars.length > 0)
    System.out.println("chars");
  else
    System.out.println("no chars");
}

public static void main(String [] args) {
  char []list = null;
  countChar(list);
}
```

The Java VM will simply check if the array parameter `chars` has the size `null`, in this case, the condition is checked to be false, and due to the "AND" logic, the second condition (which causes a null pointer exception) will never be checked.

What is the output? (Array Manipulation)
----------------------------------------

```java
public static void main (String [] args) {
  char [] characters = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'};
  print(characters);
  System.out.println(characters);
}

static void print(char [] arr) {
  arr[2] = 'K';       // Op 1.
  arr = new char[3];  // Op 2.
  arr[1] = 'Z';       // Op 3.
}
```

This sample should output "abKde", note:

- At Op 1, the array's 3rd element 'c' is replaced with 'K' (as parameter passed in).
- At Op 2 however, the `print()` method creates a new copy of character `arr` with 3 elements (in the *heap*), which would never be passed back to `main` (local to `print()`).
- At Op 3, the 2nd element in the **new copy** of the `arr` array was replaced with 'Z'. This is, however, trivial, as mentioned above.

After all, only Op 1 was "valid" to `main`, all others were disregarded at the end of the `print()` method.

What prints out? (String Manipulation)
--------------------------------------

```java
static void change(String name) {
  name.toUpperCase(); // Op 1.
  name = name + "1";
}

public static void main(String [] args) {
  String name = "Fred";
  change(name);       // Op 2.
  System.out.println("name: " + name);
}
```

Note, `String` types, when in a method, are **immutable** (unchangable). In the method `change`, a `void` typed method call, nothing will be changed on the string `name` (as nothing was returned).

Moreover, at Op 1 and Op 2, name was change to upper case (`toUpperCase()`) but only in a memory space, it was **never** stored back to the variable `name`.

To fix this program:

- Change the method type of `change()` to `String`.
- Return `name` at the end of the `change()` method.
- Store value to `name` at Op 1 and Op 2.

So that the program looks like...

```java
static String change(String name) {
  name = name.toUpperCase(); // Op 1.
  name = name + "1";
  return name;
}

public static void main(String [] args) {
  String name = "Fred";
  name = change(name);       // Op 2.
  System.out.println("name: " + name);
}
```

<div class="page-break"></div>

What are values of x and y?
---------------------------

```java
static int x = 9

public static void main(String [] args) {
  int y = 10;             // Op 1.
  x = method A(15, y);    // Op 2.
  int x = 5;              // Op 3.
  System.out.println("x=" + x + " y=" + y);
}

static int methodA(int x, int y) {
  y = 1;                  // Op 2a.
  return x + y;           // Op 2b.
}
```

The program will output:

```
x=5 y=10
```

Everything gets normally done... Except!

- At Op 2a, the `y` assigned with value "1" was disregarded at the end of the `methodA()` method.
- At Op 3, the value assigned to `x` at Op 2b, was overriden.
