Can you call this method to get the new array?
----------------------------------------------

```java
static void createBoard(int [][] board) {
  board = new int[3][3];
}
```

This sample of code will **not** return a new array (hint: the `void` type declaration) - as you can see with the `new` statement, attempting to override the array passed in with a **copy** of the array defined - this will **not** be stored as a result.

A `return` statement is crucial here.

Instead, an array could be changed if the method was only changing one or more of its elements. Then, how about this?

```java
static int[][] createBoard(int r, int c) {
  return new int[r][c];
}
```

Yes, with the `return` statement in place, it is possible to get a new array from this method.

Will this initialize the array to all 1's?
------------------------------------------

```java
public static void main(String [] args) {
  int [][] board = {{2,3},{4,3,2}};
  initBoard(board);
}

static void initBoard(int[][] board) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
      board[i][j] = 1;
}
```

This sample of code will result in an error. As the original array was a "ragged" array (not rectangular), on the iterations of `j`, the method will reference to an element out of the array's bound, resulting in an **ElementOutOfBoundException**.

Now, how about this...

```java
public static void main(String [] args) {
  int [][] board = {{2,3},{4,3,2}};
  initBoard(board);
}

static void initBoard(int[][] board) {
  for (int i = 0; i < b[i].length; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < b[j].length; j++)
      board[i][j] = 1;
}
```

This will also result in an out of bound exception. Similar to the last one... Well this is just a mess.

#### The correct way

```java
public static void main(String [] args) {
  int [][] board = {{2,3},{4,3,2}};
  initBoard(board);
}

static void initBoard(int[][] board) {
  for (int i = 0; i < b.length; i++)      // Row length.
    for (int j = 0; j < b[i].length; j++) // Column length (iterable).
      board[i][j] = 1;
}
```

How would you access "Hi."?
---------------------------

```java
String [][][] responses = {
  {{"hello"},                     // 0th row, 0th column.
    {"How do you do.", "Hi."}},
  {{"always"},
    {"When?", "Really, always?"}}
};
```

You would need to call `responses[0][1][1]` to access "Hi.". Quite confused, check on Multi-D chapter on zyBook.

What do `a` and `b` have in common?
-----------------------------------

```java
public static void main(String [] args) {
  mA();
  mB();
}

static void mA() {
  int a = 10;
}
static void mB() {
  int b;            // Op 1.
}
```

`a` and `b` is likely to be sharing the same memory address, but Java prevents access to variables' values without initialization (at Op 1).

Research on this, professor simply gave up explaining until he decided to have some fun with C, right before the end of lecture.
