Part 2
------

- Arrays, 1 and 2 dimensional.
- Static Methods.
- Parameter passing.

Keep method headers the same as provided, don't add or change parameters in any way.

Method Overload
---------------
```java
static void print(double val1, double val2) {
  System.out.println("print(double)");
}

static int print(int va1, int val2) {
  System.out.print("print(int)");
  return 1;
}

public static void main(String [] args) {
  print(10.0, 20);
}
```

This sample of code will result in a method overload, as the method `print` was declared twice with two different data types assigned.

The compiler sees a `print();` method call, however, as the method call resulted in the Java compiler to see both methods. The compiler will choose the `double` type method over the `int` type method - recall, an `int` may be contained within a `double` type, but not the other way around.

The program will print out "print(double)".

Note that Java uses "signature matching", say, we have an extra `print` method declaration as follows:

```java
static void print(double val1, int val2) {
  System.out.println("print(double)");
}
```

The compiler will instead use the method above, instead of the two already declared.

<div class="page-break"></div>

Invalid Overload
----------------

```java
static void print(double val1, double val2) {
  System.out.println("void print");
}

static int print(double num1, double num2) {
  System.out.print("int print");
}

public static void main(String [] args) {
  pritn(10.0, 20.0);
}
```

The method return type is irrelevant in this case. Java will report the issue, as the sample of code above results in an "invalid overload" - recall the "signature matching" above, Java would not be able to choose the "better" path itself, instead, it will complain.

Mind the Methods!
-----------------

```java
static void print(double val1, double val2) {
  System.out.println("print(double)");
}

static int somethng(int val1, int val2) {
  System.out.print("something");
  return 1;
}

public static void main(String [] args) {
  print(10, 20);
}
```

The "signature matching" will only allow the compiler to choose the `print();` method call (obviously), the `something();` method is irrelevant. Note how an `int` may fit in a `double`.

<div class="page-break"></div>

Naming and References
---------------------

```java
static void change(int num, int [] list) {
  num = 11;
  list[2] = num;
}

public static void main(String [] args) {
  int [] list = {1,2,3};
  int num = 10;
  change(num,list);
  System.out.println("num: " + num + "\nlist: " + Arrays.toString(list));
}
```

In the sample of code above, `num` and `list` in the `main` method is **not** the same as the `num` and `list` in the `change` method - their name being the same is pure coincidence.

Therefore, in the main method, the value of `num` was never changed, stayed as "10". However, in the case of the `list` array, the third element of the array is changed to "11".

Therefore, the program would print out:

```
num: 10
list: 1,2,11
```

Naming and References 2
-----------------------

```java
static void change(int num, int [] list) {
  list = new int[] {4,5,6};
  list[2] = num;
}

public static void main(String [] args) {
  int [] list = {1,2,3};
  int num = 10;
  change(num,list);
  System.out.println("num: " + num + "\nlist: " + Arrays.toString(list));
}
```

Nothing was changed to the `num` or the `list` array in this case, as the `new` method creates array collection **only** in the method `change`.

**Taking off the `new` statement in the `change` method will result in a compiler error, if you are wondering.**

<div class="page-break"></div>

What is the value of num?
-------------------------

```java
class Stuff {
  final static int MAX_VALUE = 10; // Allowed.
  static int num = 6; // -> NOT allowed in P2.

  static void change(int n) {
    num = n + 1;
  }

  public static void main(String [] args) {
    int num = MAX_VALUE;
    change(num);
    System.out.println("num: " + num);
    Sysetm.out.println(Stuff.num);
  }
}
```

The sample of code shows a way how `MAX_VALUE` could be declared within a class.

Therefore, the program will return the following values:

```
num: 10
Stuff.num = 11
```

As the `change` method changes the value of `num` in the Class, **but not** the `num` in the main method. Again, the same name is only a coincidence.
