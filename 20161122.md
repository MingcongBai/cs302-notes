What kind of member is `out`?
-----------------------------

```java
System.out.println("hello world");
```

`out` is a class variable (used as a instance pointer), with a convention to start with a lower-case letter, and referred to by a class; although methods are usually found starting with a lower-case letter, **must** end with parentheses - with or without arguments.

Where System is a class.

Note: `println()` then would be an instance method, given that `out` is a class variable pointing to a non-static method in a class.

Recall, given the following methods in a given class:

```java
print (float f);
print (double d);
...
```

This is called **overloading** of a method.

What are commandline arguments?
-------------------------------

```java
public class CmdLine {
  public static void main(String []args) {    // Op 1
    System.out.println(args.length);
    for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
      System.out.println(args[i]);            // Op 2
    }
  }
}
```

Commandline arguments are:

- A discussion on whether a GUI is better than the command line (wow...).
- Information passed into the program.
- The `main` method parameter.

At Op 1 specifically, arguments are passed in as a string array. For example, if we pass in argument to `main()` as...

```
Hello world how are you
```

The program will print out at Op 2 as...

```
Hello
world
how
are
you
```

Note that this array is space-deliminated, if we pass in the argument as...


```
"Hello world how are you"
```

The program will print out at Op 2 as...

```
Hello world how are you
```

Exception Handling
------------------

Exceptions has the following hierarchy.

- Runtime Exceptions
  - Unchecked Exceptions
    - Error - internal system errors
    - `RuntimeExceptions` (almost all that we have seen so far)
  - Checked Exceptions
    - Exception

There are three main types of exceptions:

- Runtime exceptions (unchecked exceptions).
- Checked exceptions.
- Errors.

### Runtime Exceptions - Programming Errors

Below are some of the more common programming errors that would result in runtime exceptions.

Division by zero (ArithmeticException).

```java
System.out.println(1/0);
```

Array index out of bounds (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException).

```java
int[] list = new int[4];
System.out.println(list[4]);
```

String index out of bounds (StringIndexOutOfBoundsException).

```java
String s = "abc";
System.out.println(s.charAt(3));
```

Class cast exception (ClassCastException).

```java
Object o = new Object();
String d = (String) o;
```

Null pointer exception (NullPointerException).

```java
Object o = null;
o.toString;
```

### Stack Trace

Here below is a pseudo stack trace sample.

```java
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Object cannot be cast to java.lang.String
  at Test.method2(Test.java:5)
  at Test.method1(Test.java:9)
  at Test.main(Test.java:29)
```

What happens when...
--------------------

```java
try {
  statement1;
  statement2; // Eceptiopn thrown.
  statement3;
}

catch (Exception1 e) {
  ...
}
catch (Exception2 e) {
  ...
}

statement4;
```

- **Will statement 3 be executed?** No, a caught exception effectively terminates the program in the `try` block.
- **If exception is caught, will statement4 be executed?** Yes, as it is outside of the `try` block.

### Another version

```java
int methodA() throws Exception5 {
  try {
    statement1;
    statement2;
    statement3;
  }

  catch( Exception1 e) {
    statementE;
    throw new Exception5(“some message”); // Op 1
  }
  finally {
    statement4;
  }

  Statement5;
  return 1;
}
```

An exception was thrown in a `catch` block (Op 1), which is never caught, the program terminates.

Note: `finally` is always executed, as it cleans up itself before the program exits.
