Loose Notes
-----------

- When an variable was created using the standard Object initialization, the variable is an `instanceof` Object.
- Up-casting is always safe. Casting down the class hierarchy results in a `ClassCastingException`.

What prints out?
----------------

```java
class KT {
  public String toString() {
    return "kt";
  }
}

class CT extends KT {}

class Kitchen {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Object o = new CT();
    System.out.println(o);
  }
}
```

Note that in the sample above, by the `extends` of a class, in this case, `CT` inherits `KT`, when calling for `o.toString()`, the "closest" - in this case, `KT` which `CT` inherited upon - was called (`KT`'s `toString()` effectively overrides the one defined in `Object`).

The sample of code above will print out "kt".
