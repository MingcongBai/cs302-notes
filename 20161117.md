What's happening in Memory?
---------------------------

```java
public static Cup {
  static int count = 0;                   // Class variable
  public String whos = "?";               // Instance variable

  public Cup(String name) {
    this.whos = name;
    count++;
  }
}

public static void main(String [] args) {
  Cup[] cups = new Cup[5];
  for (int i = 0; i < cups.length; i++) { // Op 1
    cups[i] = new Cup("" + i);            // Op 2
  }                                       // Op 3
}
```

Note:

- Variables on the stack are not automatically initialized.
- Contents, instances on the heap are automatically initialized.
- The variable `i` (handle) in the for-loop is also stored in the stack, but only in the scope of the loop itself - deminished after the loop execution (Op 1 - Op 3).
- The array variable is on the stack, but the array itself (and its elements) are on the heap.
- Class area of memory (storing the class variables and their contents) will exist throughout the program - similar but distinct from the stack (not a concern of this course).

Java Interfaces
---------------

In a Java Interface, there is no method body:

- Interfaces is *"kind of a class, but kind of not"* (Thanks). An interface shows how a certain interface could be used (or what is to be called), but not the implementation itself.
- Interfaces allow a declaration of a type.

Much rather, a separate class would implement the interface.

```java
public class Circle implements Shape {}
```

Where you would need to implement the call declared in an interface, say, we have:

```java
void draw();
```

As a part of the `Shape` interface, then you would need to implement a method for `draw()`;

```java
public void draw() { ... }
```

Then, in a `main()` method *somewhere*, do this:

```java
Shape s = new Circle();
s.draw();
```

And you are good to go. Note that this method of implementation could be morphed into an element of an array, array list, etc. As it is visible to the Java compiler as a data type/type reference:

```java
Shape []shapes = new Shapes[5];
shapes[0] = new Circle();
shapes[1] = new Triangle();

for (int i = 0; i < shapes.length; i++) {
  if (shapes[i] != null) {
    shapes[i].draw();                     // Polymorphism, f*ck yeet!
  }
}
```

Essentially the same idea.

Note:

- One class may only extend one object.
- One class may implement any given number of interfaces.

True or false?
--------------

- **If the object attributes are initialized in the class declaration, there is no need to create objects?**
  - False. You would need to create an object.
- **Objects of the same class cannot have equal attribute values?**
  - False. Objects of the same class could have equal attribute values.
- **Objects are allocated the same amount of memory regardless of definition and instantiation?**
  - False. Objects are allocated by the memory required by the instances, etc.
- **Objects "know" which methods are operating on them?**
  - False.
- **Cannot have methods with the same name in different classe?**
  - False. Please don't make me explain that.
- **You can define a method that divides the object into two different objects?**
  - False. Nein. Nada.
- **You can invoke a method on an object only once?**
  - False. The constructor only is called once, but others may be called for any given times.
- **A method can be invoked on any object of a class?**
  - False. This only applies to non-static/instance methods.
- **The creation of an object of a composed class automatically creates objects of the simple class that appear as attributes of the composed class?**
  - False. An object would not be automatically created.
