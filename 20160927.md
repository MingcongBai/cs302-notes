What is the value of sum?
-------------------------

```java
int sum = 0;
boolean done = false;

for ( int i = 1; i < 4 && !done; i++ ) {
  for ( int j = 6; j > 3; j-- ) {
    if (j > 4 ) continue;
    sum+= 1;
  }
  if ( i == 3 ) break;
}

System.out.println("sum=" + sum);
```

The answer will **not** be "9" in this case. Remember the two terminologies below:

- `continue` results in a return to the condition check of the local loop.
- `break` reulits in the termination of the local loop.

What is the difference between these loops?
-------------------------------------------

```java
int a = 1;
while ( a < 5 ) {
  System.out.println("hello");
  a++;
}
```

And...

```java
for ( int = a; a < 5; a++ ) {
  System.out.println("hello");
}
```

- A. Not much.
- B. Not appropriate for `while`.
- C. `for` is better.

All of the choices above are true: functionality is identical, printing "hello" for 4 times.

Although `while` is a valid choice here, `for` is a more suitable choice, as a `for` loop is capable of aggregating all of the conditions and operations inside of the loop statement.

Arrays
------

As opposed to single-value variables we have been using prior to this point, an array is a series of values of the same type under the same name. The "variable name" is now an "index".

### Which are valid ways to create arrays?

```java
int []list1;                      // 1
int [] list2 = new int[5];        // 2
int list3 =  new int[]{1,2,3};    // 3
int []list4 = new int[1,2,3,4];   // 4
```

"2" is correct, while others aren't. A correct initialization and usage of an array is shown below:

```java
int [] list1;                     // Saving references to the memory.
list1 = new int[5];               // Creating an int index of 5 elements.
list1[2] = 5;                     // Assign a value of 5 to the third element in the array.
int i = list1[3];                 // Assign a variable i with the fourth element in the array.
```

- The first way "1" is incorrect, because it only holds a reference in memory of the array, without setting up the array.
- The third way "3" may seem correct, but instead of creating an index of 3 elements, it creates an index of 3 elements **and** assigns each element with "1", "2", "3".
- The fourth way "4" is simply syntactic incorrect.

### Which array initializations are valid?

```java
int [] listA = new int[4];        // 1
int [] listB = new int[]{8,7,6};  // 2

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
int sizeC = input.nextInt();
list [] listC = new int[sizeC];   // 3
```

"1", "2", "3" should all be valid ways of initializing an array.

- "1" is called an implicit initialization, assigning all elements in the array with 0's.
- "2" is called an explicit initialization, assigning all elements in the array with specified values.
- "3" is an interactive initialization of an array (in term of size of the array), then initializes an array with implicit initialization like the one in "1".

### Will these show the contents of these arrays?

```java
char [] chars = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'};
System.out.println(chars);        // 1

int [] list = {10, 2, 23, 64};
System.out.println(list);         // 2
```

Only "1" will print out the correct contents of the array, while "2" will not. By design, `prinln()` simply isn't able to print out `int` arrays, but it is capable of printing `char` arrays.
