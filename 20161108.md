=============

How are these terms related?
----------------------------

- field, attribute, member variable
- class, related data and methods, template
- object, instance
- instance variable, non-static variable
- class field, static field, static variable

All these vocabulary words are grouped into synonyms by each line.

Should a final field always be static?
--------------------------------------

```java
class Config {
  final int NUM_ROWS = 4;
  static final int NUM_STICKS = 5;
}
```

In the sample above, `final` specifies that a variable cannot be changed once initialized. However, you may not use `Config.NUM_ROWS` as it is not static - you would need to create an instance first.

With that said, a `final` static would not always need to be static.

What will print out?
--------------------

```java
class Employee {
  private static int employeeCount = 0;
  private final int id;                       // Op 1

  Employee() {
    this.id = ++employeeCount;                // Op 2
  }
  private static void main(String [] args) {
    Employee anEmployee = new Employee();     // Op 3
    System.out.println(anEmployee.id);
  }
}
```

This sample of code above will print out 0. The code has initialized `employeeCount` as `static` but not `final`, it could therefore be changed. However, the `id` variable was initialized as `final` - in which case it's fine, as the `main()` method did initialize an instance for this class (at Op 3).

However nothing was done after the initialization. Therefore the `id` variable to be printed out would be 1 - as the `++` notation preceeds the `employeeCount` variable at Op 2 - also note that at Op 1, the `id` variable was not yet assigned a value.

<div class="page-break"></div>

Will the default constructor be provided in this case?
------------------------------------------------------

```java
class Cup {
  private String contents;
  Cup(String contents) {
    this.contents = contents;
  }
}
```

No. The default constructor will only be provided when there is **no** constructor provided in the class.

Which are true?
---------------

```java
class Light {
}

// In some method.

Light aLight = new Light();
System.out.println(aLight);
```

(To be completed)

How many Bug instance is in list?
---------------------------------

```java
ArrayList<Bug> list;
list.add(new Bug());
Bug aBug = new Bug();
list.add(aBug);
list.add(0, aBug);
```

The array list was never created in this sample above. Therefore there is no array list implemented in this sample.
