Multi-D Array - How many elements will this array hold?
-------------------------------------------------------

```java
int [][] board = new int[5][5];
```

This statement above will initialize an array of size 5-by-5, therefore `5 * 5 = 25` array elements are hold in this particular array.

What is the data type of board[1][2]?
-------------------------------------

```java
int [][] board = new int[5][5];
```

This statement initializes an array `board` with data type...

But stop there right now, this is an array of type `int`, which means that this is a collection of references to multiple `int` - in this case, 25 `int`s. However, any given element of an `int`-typed array is `int`-typed, therefore `board[1][2]` in question is also `int`-typed.

What is the data type of board[1]?
----------------------------------

```java
int [][] board = new int[5][5];
```

Similar to the sample above, this is an `int`-typed array, while using `board[n][n]` where `0 <= x < 5` pin-points an element in the array. However, `board[1]`, like `board[n]` where `0 <= x < 5` specifies a *"row"* in the dimensional space - this is essentially a single-dimensional array with `int` data type - this `board[1]` has a data type of `int[]`.

Note: there is no specific rules for which being *"row"*, or it being *"column"* - as long as you keep the dimensions consistent.

What values will this array have initially?
-------------------------------------------

```java
boolean [][] board;         // Op 1.
board = new boolean[5][5];  // Op 2.
```

The array's elements were never initialized as of Op 1, while Op 2 declares that the array `board` has 2 dimensions, with a total of `5 * 5 = 25` elements. By the definition of a `boolean`-typed array, all elements would be assigned value "false" - similarly, an `int`-typed array will be initialized with value "0", by its definition.

Note: a multi-dimensional array is essentially a collection of multiple single-dimensional arrays.

Which is the correct way to set an element value?
-------------------------------------------------

```java
int [][] board = new int[5][5];
```

There were 3 choices given in class, as follows:

- A. `board[0][0] = 5;`
- B. `board[0,0]` = 5;`
- C. `board{0,0} = 5`;

Just remember, as defined in the Java language, "A" is the correct choice here.

Where in memory is variable board?
----------------------------------

```java
static void main(String [] args) {
  int [][] board = new int[r][c];
}
```

In this sample of code (ignoring the undefined `r` and `c` variables) puts the array `board[][]` in the "stack" area - being it called within `main()`; However, the array itself is allocated within the "heap".

How many elements in the array?
-------------------------------

```java
int [][] board = {{1,2},{4,5,6}};
```

This sample of code should initialize a two-dimensional array with 5 elements - there is no "left-overs", as a two-dimensional array does **not** necessarily have to be a rectangle in "shape" - when visualized.
