This week's topic: debug and loops.

This week
---------

- P1 Miestone 2 due Thursday by 8:00 A.M..
  - Commenting example.
- Exam confirmation and Accommodation requests due Friday.
- CS Learning Center.
  - In CS Building, above entrance to Union South.

Debugging
---------

- Print statements.
- Java Visualizer.
- Breakpoints in Eclipse.

**Fun fact:** the name "bug" that refers to computer program errors/issues, was originally a moth found in an early computer.

#### What is print out?

```java
char choice = 'a';
switch (choice) {
  case 'a': System.out.print("a");
  case 'b': System.out.print("b");
    break;
  default: System.out.print("other");
    break;
}
```

The program will print out "ab", as the program dropped-through, after the statement:

```java
case 'a': System.out.print("a");
```

The program prints "a".

As the initial `choice` was assigned a "char-literal" avlue `'a'`. The `choice` call sees `'a'` (indeed), and goes to the statement above. However, without a `break;` statement at the end of each `case`, the program will drop through and print the next statement, in this case:

```java
case 'b': System.out.print("b");
```

Regardless of the assignment to be `'a'` or `'b'`, the program will print "b" on the same line, therefore, the program prints out "ab".

**Take-away: each case must end with a `break;` statement.**

<div class="page-break"></div>

The ? operator (not recommended)
--------------------------------

A `?` operator has the syntax as follows:

```java
condition ? <true value> : <false value>
```

The program logic goes... (BTW, what is printed out?)

```java
// What is out?
String out = "don't know";
boolean sunny = false;
out = sunny ? "sunny" : "cloudy";
```

The program should print out "cloudy". The original conditional expression:

```java
out = sunny ? "sunny" : "cloudy";
```

May be expanded as...

```java
if (String(out).equals("sunny")) {
  out = sunny;
}
else {
  out = cloudy;
}
```

Therefore, if it's not "sunny" assigned to the `String` variable `out`, it will print out "cloudy" regardless what `out` was assigned with.

Scanner problem
---------------

What are the final assignments of this program for `num` and `str4`.

```java
String note = "Hmm\na 3\nline note.";
Scanner input = new Scanner(note);

int num = 0;
String str1 = input.nextLine();
String str2 = input.next();

if (input.hasNextInt()) {
  num = input.nextInt();
}

String str4 = input.nextLine();
```

Recall: the pointer operation in a `next()`, `nextInt()`, and `nextLine()` call may be visualized as follows:

```java
input.nextInt()   ->    "20 25\nscores"
                           ^
input.nextInt()   ->    "20 25\nscores"
                              ^
input.nextLine()  ->    "20 25\nscores"
                                ^
input.nextLine()  ->    "20 25\nscores"
                                      ^
```

In this case:

```java
input.nextLine()   ->    "Hmm\na 3\nline note."
                              ^
input.next()       ->    "Hmm\na 3\nline note."
                                ^
input.nextInt()    ->    "Hmm\na 3\nline note."
                                  ^
input.nextLine()   ->    "Hmm\na 3\nline note."
                                    ^
```

Therefore, at the last statement, the `nextLine()` call only gives a `newline` character, instead of the remainder of the original string.

The `nextInt()` statement will work as expected (as seen in the visualization above) to assign "3" to `num`, but not the second one which assigned `\n` (invisible) to `str4`.

Therefore, the answer is:

```
num: 3
str4:
```

char - Which will compile?
--------------------------

```java
int intValue = 0;
char aChar = 'B';

intValue = aChar;     // (1)
aChar = intValue + 1; // (2)
aChar = '\u0041'      // (3)
```

To break down the results:

- **(1):** Will compile, as `char` has a length of 16-bit (2 bytes in this case, for each letter takes up 2 bytes), while an `int` type has a length of 32-bit (or 4 bytes). Therefore `char` may be implicitly converted to `int`.
- **(2):** Will not compile, as mentioned above, the length of `intValue` will not fit into the length of a `char`, or `aChar` in this case. An `int` type may not be implicitly converted to a `char`type.
- **(3):** Will compile, `aChar` was assigned with an Hexadecimal value of an Unicode character, the compiler will accept this assignment as a legitimate value (as an Unicode character is 2 bytes in length).

The compiler will successfully compile (1) and (3), but not (2).

#### To fix (2)

```java
aChar = (char)(intValue + 1);
```

To cast `int` into `char`, given that `char` will eventually take an ASCII number assignment.

**Take-away: the compiler checks data type instead of the actual length, especially in the case of an `int`.**

Increment and Decrement
-----------------------

```java
i = i + 1;      i = i - 1;
i += 1;         i -= 2;
i++;            --i;
++i;            i--;
```

What are equivalent in each of these eight statements?

Puzzle
------

```java
int i = 5, j = 2, k; // Short hand for multiple int initializations.
j += 3;
k = i++ + --j;
```

After this executes, what are the values in `i`, `j`, and `k`?
