Course Review (Partial)
-----------------------

Basic fluency in Java (next up is CS 367 - Data Structures):

- P1: Sequence, conditions, loops, console I/O.
- P2: Static methods, parameter passing, arrays.
- P3: Classes, instances, instance methods.
- P4: Multiple classes, Object-Oriented Design.

And extra skills:

- Incremental development and testing.
- Tracing code.
- Basic debugging: print statements, breakpoints.

What do these do?
-----------------

```java
for (char ch = 'A'; ch < 'Z'; ch += 3) {
  System.out.print(ch);
}
```

In this sample of code, ASCII characters are implicitly casted to `int`, therefore printing 'A', skip two characters to the third, 'D'... and so on, all the way to the end of the alphabet.

```java
ArrayList<Bug> bugs = new ArrayList<>();
bugs.add(new Bug());                      // Op 1
for (int i = 0; i < bugs.size(); i++) {   // Op 2
  bugs.add(new Bug());
}
```

The sample of code holds an array list of `Bug` instances/objects, at Op 1, the array list has a size of 1 - runs `for` loop at Op2.

However, for each loop iteration, the `bugs` size increases by one (by definition of array lists), then the loop will execute infinitely, as the `bugs` size keeps increasing.
