Abstract Class vs. Interface, vs. Concrete Class
------------------------------------------------

The sample below shows a use case of an abstract class: a class containing abstract methods, while it is possible to include "true" methods in these classes. Another class extending this abstract class would provide *concrete* body for some abstract methods in the abstract class.

```java
abstract class Drg {
  abstract int count();
  void print() {
    System.out.print("hello");
  }
}

class MyDrg extends Drg {
  int count() {
    return 3;
  }
}
```

The sample below shows a use case of an interface: a type of class that contains *no* concrete methods, rather, the methods are *implemented* in another class that dictates that it `implements` a specific interface, with all concrete methods of the same name and parameter.

```java
interface Drg {
  int count();                  // Note: public abstract properties.
  void print();
}

class MyDrg implements Drg {
  int count() {
    return3;
  }
  void print() {
    System.out.print("hello");
  }
}
```

What will print out?
--------------------

```java
Class Pop {
  public boolean equals(Object o) {         // Op 1
    System.out.print("O ");
    return false;
  }

  public boolean equals(pop p) {            // Op 2
    System.out.print("P ");
    return true;
  }

  public static void main(String []args) {
    Pop p1 = new Pop();
    Pop p2 = new Pop();

    Object o = p1;                          // Op 3
    p1.equals(p2);                          // Op 4
    o.equals(p2);                           // Op 5
    p2.equals(o);                           // Op 6
  }
}
```

The sample of code above will print out "P O P". Op 4 is of the origin of `Pop` class - and more over, uses a `Pop` instance as argument - therefore Op 2 is chosen over Op 1 (printing out "P "). Op 5 is of the origin of `Object` class (up-casted), there is only one choice, which is Op 1 (printing out "O "). Op 6 is quite tricky, even though the method call originated from the `Pop` class, the argument specifies an `Object`, Op 2 is chosen over Op 1 (printing out "O ").

Note:

- Op 1 is actually an override of the `equals()` method in the `Object` class.
- Op 1 *overrides*, and Op 2 *overlaods*.
- Op 3 is an up-cast.

What will print out?
--------------------

```java
abstract class Drg {
  abstract int count();
  public void print() {
    System.out.print(count());    // Op 2
  }
}

class MyDrg extends Drg {
  int count() {
    return 3;                     // Op 3
  }
}

// In main.
MyDrg d = new MyDrg();
d.print();                        // Op 1
```

The sample of code above will print out "3". At Op 1, the method calls print from `MyDrg`, in which case the method would be found in `Drg`, which calls to print out the result/return of `count()` at Op 2. However, note that there is no method body for `count()` from within `Drg` (nor would it matter! This is an abstract method) - therefore the `count()` in `MyDrg` (extended from `Drg`) would be called, at Op 3, returning 3, and printed out at Op 3.

Therefore printing out "3".
