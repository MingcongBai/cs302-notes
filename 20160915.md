Values of a1 and a2?
--------------------

```java
String str1 = "Hello";
String str2 = new String( "Hello" );

boolean a1 = str1 == str2;
boolean a2 = str1.equals(str2);
```

`str1` contains only memory addresses that contains binaries that translates to "Hello", not the string itself. `==` was only able to compare memory references, but not the string itself.

#### Another example

```java
char ch1 = 'H';
String str = "Hello";
char ch2 = str.charAt(0);

boolean a1 = ch1 == ch2;
boolean a2 = ch1.equals(ch2);
```

A `char` contains 2 bytes, containing references to the Unicode table - `char` is a primitive data type. `ch1` and `ch2` both contain `H`, `boolean a1` should return true.

In the case of `boolean a2` assignment, the `equals()` method follows the reference in memory and compares the content. As both `ch1` and `ch2` are primitive type, a compiler error is expected - the program simply won't run.

java.lang.Math methods
----------------------

```java
double numInts = Math.pow(2, 32); // Power operation.
double root = Math.sqrt(16); // Square root.

int age1 = 5;
int age2 = 25;

// Assign the bigger number to big.
double big = Math.max(age1, age2);
```

Which of the methods is called with...

```java
double big = Math.max(age1, age2);
```

In this case, with `Math.max`, what's being input to the method is respected (`int` in this case). Therefore,

```java
int max(int a, int b);
```

Is called instead of,

```java
double max(double a, double b);
```

<div class="page-break"></div>

Style or method?
----------------

Does the following two examples return the same result?

#### Example A

```java
boolean tired = true;

if (tired) {
  // Take break.
  tired = false;
}
if (!tired) {
  // Keep working.
}
```

#### Example B

```java
boolean tired = true;

if (tired) {
  // Take break.
  tired = false;
}
else {
  // Keep working.
}
```

Imagine a river, Example A is like a side-trip on the river; Example B is more like an island in the middle of the river, where the person on the boat may choose to get past from either side of the island.

The two logics presented in each example are fundamentally different. In Example A, both branches of the `if-else` statement are run through regardless (if initially `tired` was assigned `true`, then it will be assigned a different value `false`, and go on to the second branch); in example B, only one branch of the `if-else` statement is executed, as the program may only run via one of the branches (if initially `tired` was assigned `true`, only the first branch will be executed to assign `false` to `tired`, and the program will end at the end of that `if` statement - never going onto the `else` statement).

Equivalent?
-----------

#### Option A:

```java
char chr = // Any valid assignment.
char out = 'W';

if ( chr == 'A' ) {
  out = 'X';
} else if ( chr == 'B' ) {
  out = 'Y';
} else {
  out = 'Z';
}
```

#### Option B:

```java
char chr = // Any valid assignment.
char out = 'W';

if ( chr == 'A' ) {
  out = 'X';
} if ( chr == 'B' ) {
  out = 'Y';
} if ( chr != 'A' || chr != 'B' ) {
  out = 'Z';
}
```

Dangling Else
-------------

```java
int value = 0;
String out = "abc";

if (value >= 1)
  if (value <=10)
    out = "1 to 10";
else
    out = "else";
```

Shown above is a classic "Dangling Else" problem. Java does not require braces for compilations to pass, in this case, `else` goes with the **closest** `if`. Therefore, the first statement...

```java
if (value >= 1)
```

Is essentially disregarded. Given that the initial `value` was assigned with `0`, complying with the statement...

```java
if (value <= 10)
```

Therefore the program returns...

```java
out = "1 to 10";
```

Instead of the expected...

```java
out = "else";
```

What is the proper indentation of this program? Think.
