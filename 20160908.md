Puzzle (from last lecture)
--------------------------

```java
int a;
int b;
a = 5;
b = 3;
```

Write code to swap values in `a` & `b`.

#### My own solution

```java
int c; // Initialize a intermediate variable.
c = a; // Swap-out a.
a = b; // Assign value of b to a.
b = c; // Swap-in value of a via c.
```

Without the 3rd/temporary variable?
-----------------------------------

Say, we have `a = 20`, `b = 30`.

```java
int a = 20;
int b = 30;
```

Using a basic "algorithm", taking advantage of the `int` declaration, simple additions and substractions may do the trick.

```java
a = a + b; // 20+30=50
b = a - b; // 50-30=20
a = a - b; // 50-20=30
```

Declaration, print, and literal
-------------------------------

```java
int numCars = 9;
int numTrucks = 4;

System.out.print( numCars );
System.out.print( nunCars + numTracks );
System.out.print( "numCars" + numTracks );
```

In the sample code above...

- `System`: A collection of system call.
- `out`: Attribute that specifies action category, `out` in I/O operation here, for example.
- `print`: Instance that carries out a particular method call.
- `()`: Parameters (in experssions).
- `+`: Operator overloading, combining operations. Declaration types like `int` will allow this notation to represent addition/summation.
- `""`: String literal.

Special call instance of `println` allows Java to print output with a `newline` character at the end of the output line. For instance:

```java
System.out.print( numCars );
```

Results in an output of:

```
9
```

And...

```java
System.out.println( numCars );
```

Results in an output of:

```
9
(newline)
```

Try and print
-------------

Starting with:

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 3;
```

Produce output:

```
a has 5
b has 3
```

#### My solution

```java
System.out.println( "a has " + a );
System.out.print( "b has " + b );
```

<div class="page-break"></div>

Escape sequences
----------------

Special character sequences within a String.

```
\n  \"  \\  \t
```

In an example...

```java
System.out.print( "hello\n\t\"hi\"\\" );
```

Outputs...

```
hello
  "hi"\
```
