What variables are used for the state of "instance who's reference is in p"?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

```java
class Person {
  private static count = 0;
  private boolean amHungry = false; // The only instance variable.
  public Person(String name) {}
}
public static void main(String [] args) {
  Person p = new Person("Fred");
}
```

`amHungry` will be the variable used for the state of "instance who's reference is in p":

- `static` variable(s) (`count` in this case) were never stored as a part of memory in an instance.
- `Person(String name)` were merely allocated with any sort of memory reference, for it being an empty method which happens to take an argument of a `String`-typed variable.

Therefore, the non-static `amHungry` boolean variable is used for the state specified.

Will toString return results of Graphic toString()?
---------------------------------------------------

```java
class Bird {
  private Graphic graphic;                // Op 1
  Bird(String name) {                     // Op 2
    Graphic graphic = new Graphic(name);  // Op 3
  }

  public String toString() {
    return graphic.toString;              // Op 4
  }
}
```

This sample of code will return a `NullPointerException`:

- Op 1 is an instance variable (therefore stored in the heap).
- Op 2 contains `name` which is simply a parameter for the constructor (therefore stored on the stack) - only exists for during the method call.
- Op 3 stores an variable on the stack, as it is a local variable - a different variable than the one in Op 1.
- Op 4 tries to access graphic with no content (and no pointer! A null), therefore a null pointer exception.

<div class="page-break"></div>

Does this print out true or false?
----------------------------------

```java
class Person {
  static int count = 0;
  private boolean something = false;

  boolean getThing(boolean something) {
    return this.something;
  }

  Person p = new Person();
  System.out.println(p.getThing(true));
}
```

This sample of code will return `false`, as the `getThing()` method never change the `something` instance variable in the class, rather, it simply returned with the value of the instance variable `something`, which is false, and never was changed.
