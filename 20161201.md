If methodA doesn't throw an exception, then output is?
------------------------------------------------------

```java
try {
  methodA(args);          // Op 1
  System.out.print("B");  // Op 2
}
catch (MyException e) {
  throw e;
  System.out.print("C");
}
finally {
  System.out.print("D");  // Op 3
}
System.out.print("E");    // Op 4
```

The sample of code above will print out "BDE", at Op 1, no exception was thrown, therefore Op 2 was executed to print out "B", the `catch` block will not execute. Op 3 at the `finally` block will always be executed by definition to print out "D", and Op 4 will execute - as there is no exception.

What is the file format this code is reading?
---------------------------------------------

```java
Scanner input = new Scanner(sourceFile);

while (input.hasNext()) {
  String name = input.nextLine();                   // Op 1
  if (!name.equals("EOF")) {
    String [] hwd = input.nextLine().split(",");    // Op 2
    int count = Integer.parseInt(input.nextLine());
    int height = Integer.parseInt(input.hwd[0]);
    int width = Integer.parseInt(input.hwd[1]);
    ...
  }
}
```

This should be relatively easy to comprehend, just follow the pointer. Note that at Op 2, the `split()` was used to cut a line (Op 1 checks if the first line is the end of file) to create an array with elements of each segments.
