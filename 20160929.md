Can a machine show intelligent behavior?
----------------------------------------

Read also [Wikipedia: Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test).

What is the data type of listG?
-------------------------------

```java
String [] listG = {"first", "middle", "last"};
```

- A. String
- B. Array of String
- C. Compiler error
- D. JVM error

The example shown above is an "array of String", `listG` is a String-typed variable that contains an array of `String`.

Which are true?
---------------

```java
String []arr = new String[3];
arr[0] = "hello";
arr[1] = "hello";
arr[2] = new String("hello");

System.out.println(arr[1] == "hello");      // 1
System.out.println(arr[1].equals("hello")); // 2
System.out.println(arr[2] == arr[1]);       // 3
System.out.println(arr[2].equals(arr[1]));  // 4
```

- A. 1,2,3,4
- B. 1,3,4
- C. 2,3,4
- D, 2,4

The code above creates a new array `arr` with 3 `String` elements, where:

- Index 0 is assigned "hello";
- Index 1 is assigned "hello";
- Index 2 is assigned to a new "hello" copy in the memory;

Where index 0 and 1, to the compiler, are the same (one copy in memory); index 2 however, is assigned as "hello", but in another location in the memory.

- 1) Compares two memory **references**, as discussed above, they are indeed the same, and `==` is a valid notation.
- 2) Easy to see, the reference compares with the **content** of `arr[1]`, therefore it's true.
- 3) Compares **reference** from `arr[2]` to `arr[1]`, as discussed above, `arr[2]` stores the same "hello" string in a different location in memory.
- 4) Compares the **content** of `arr[2]` and `arr[1]`, and as they both contain an identical string "hello", it holds true.
