How many times will this execute?
---------------------------------

```java
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
int num;
int sum = 0;
do {
  num = input.nextInt();
  sum+= num;
} while ( num > 0 );
```

This loop will run until

```java
num <= 0;
```

As while-do loop checks its condition **after** the `do{}` logic is performed. The loop has no definite end until the condition defined in `while` is violated.

Note: if `num` condition is violated, the loop still run **one extra time**, until it checks its condition again, and quits the loop.

Another example
---------------

Body of `while` will execute...

```java
boolean finished = false;

while ( !( finished = true ) ) {
  String line = input.nextLine();
  if ( line.equals( "done" ) ) {
    finished = true;
  }
  else {
    System.out.println( "echo:" + line );
  }
}
```

- A. Until "done" is input.
- B. Never.
- C. Forever.
- D. Other?

On the second statement...

```java
while ( !( finished = true ) ) {
```

Note the `=` in place of `==`, `finished` is assigned `true`, instead of comparing its value. Assigned with such value, with the initial value of `false`, therefore, the loop never executes. The correct answer is B.

It is usually suggested that one never use actual comparison in while (if) condition statements, use the following instead (until it is necessary to explicitly state such comparisons):

```java
while ( !finished ) {
```

How many "hello"s?
------------------

```java
for ( int a = 0;  a <= 5; a++ ) {
  System.out.print("hello ");
}
```

From 0 to 5, including 5, that's 6 total valid numbers:

```
0   1   2   3   4   5
(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)
```

Therefore, in total, 6 "hello"s were printed.

Yet Another Example
-------------------

```java
for ( int a = 5; a >= 1; a++ ) {
  System.out.print("hello ")
}
```

This loop will never end, as `a` was initially assigned "5", which is larger than the **only** condition `a >= 1`, and `a` only increments in value...

`a` will always fit in the condition, and the loop will never end.

How many "bye"s?
----------------

```java
for ( int i = 1; i <= 5; i++ ) {
  for ( int j = 2; j < 6; j++ ) {
    System.out.print("bye ");
  }
}
```

It is quite easy to calculate the total execution count of a loop by multiplying the execution counts of the outer loop and the inner loop.

In this case:

```(5 - 1 + 1) * (5 - 2 + 1) = 20```

Because in every execution of the outer loop, the inner loop executes all of its iteration.

In other words: as the outer loop runs with `i = 1`, the inner loop will go through `j = 2, j = 3, ..., j = 5`.

<div class="page-break"></div>

What does this print?
---------------------

```java
for ( int i = 1; i <= 5; i++ ) {
  for ( int j = 1; j <= 3; j++ ) {
    System.out.print(i + "," + j + " ");
  }
  System.out.println();
}
```

The inner and outer loop still runs as expected, like the example above. Therefore, the final result returns:

```
1,1 1,2 1,3
2,1 2,2 2,3
3,1 3,2 3,3
4,1 4,2 4,3
5,1 5,2 5,3
```
